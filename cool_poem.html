    <h2>My Cool Poem</h2>

    <h3><em> Cricket Unites a Nation</em></h3>

    <div id="poem">
     <p>
         The men with bats are coming home back with good news.

<br>They are here to distribute bundles of joy on rickshaws to everyone in our neighborhood.

<br>Thank god, our family will stop bickering and the tension will be defused.

<br>Finally, I can be just a kid hanging out with my friends and have a normal childhood.

<br>Sadly, the sweet taste of success eventually leaves everyone’s mouth.

<br>Once again, I get thrown from the clear sunny skies back into the black pit of loneliness.

<br>Suddenly, the fights resume and the commodities of tolerance and serenity go into a drought.

<br>Why can’t we be happy all the time? The attitudes of some are just odious.

<br>Hopefully, the men in bats will come back and hurry soon.

<br>And once again arrive with the magical good news.

<br>So that once again, to all the pain and sorrow, my family can be immune.

<br>Whatever you do, great men with bats, do me a favor and don’t lose.
